<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to showcase various skills producing predictive AI models.
It is important to note there was no intent on defending the fidelity of the results from the data. 
The datasets could not be verified and were from unofficial kaggle sources.
I chose to do a raw SQLAlchemy query conversion to showcase my understanding of how they work.
I chose to utilize spark dataframes to show my knowledge base with them and my ability to convert raw data to them.
I chose to use deep learning models to display my ability converting data types to work with the deep models.

## The Process
I bought a virtual private server from GoDaddy to begin the whole endeavor. I had used AWS RDS servers in the past but found
they can become increasingly expensive in an expedited fashion.

The next phase was to connect to the VPS. There are number of ways to achieve this objective. I chose PuTTy. 
PuTTy allows you to access in a remote fashion servers you have set up.

After connecting to the VPS I had to create the database, user, access information, and edit traffic permissions
all through the ubuntu remote shell.
